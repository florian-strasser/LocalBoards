#
# Built on the official MySQL image rather than on Node, so the container can
# carry its own database and `docker run` works on a bare machine. That is the
# wrong way round for a Node app, but the database is the half with exacting
# requirements — a correct data directory, the right defaults, first-run
# initialisation — while Node is a self-contained tarball that drops onto any
# glibc.
#
# MySQL specifically, not MariaDB: the schema uses `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`, which
# only MySQL 8 has.
#
# The cost is size: this image is a few hundred MB rather than the ~80 MB a
# node:slim base gives, and every deployment pays it even when using an external
# database. The alternative — publishing two images — doubles the release
# surface and asks every reader to choose before they know what they want.
