## 0.5.2

- Fixed a small issue with the invite system after the API Access was introduced.

## 0.5.1

- We introduced a dark mode. If the device prefers a dark scheme we show it to the user. Otherwise they will still see the bright layout.

- You can now generate API keys with the same permissions as your user account. This enables you to build custom tools and automate workflows, making your experience with LocalBoards even more powerful and efficient.
