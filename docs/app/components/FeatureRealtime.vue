         white panels on the grey surface, grey cards inside. One card is
         dragged Backlog → In Progress, ticked off where it is being worked on,
         then filed in Done — and the areas open and close a slot for it exactly
         as they do when you drag a card in LokalBoards, so the card is really
         put down rather than floated over the top.

         The two drags are made by two different people: the blue cursor hands
         the card over, the green one finishes it. -->
