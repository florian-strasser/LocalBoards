  <!-- Every page renders its own header and says how it should look, rather
       than the header working the current route out for itself.

       In the flow, on every page, in every state. There was an `absolute` mode
       that took it out of the flow; no page ever asked for it, and a header
       that leaves the flow on one route and not the next moves the page's top
       edge between them — the jump this component was written to fix. The same
       is true while the menu is open: pinning the whole row put the logo over
       the scrolling list, with entries sliding underneath it. Only the button
       that opens and closes the menu is pinned — see it below — because it is
       the one thing that has to stay reachable however far the list has been
       scrolled. -->
  <header class="absolute top-0 left-0 z-20 w-full py-6" role="banner">
    <!-- The sheet the small-screen menu opens into.

         The scrolling panel covers the whole viewport (top padding keeps the
         first entry clear of the close button) rather than starting beneath the
         header. `w-screen` rather than `inset-0`, because a fixed element's
         right edge stops at the content edge — inside the gutter the page has
         reserved — which drew the panel's scrollbar with an empty channel to
         the right of it. A hundred viewport-widths reaches the window edge, so
         the one visible bar sits exactly where the page's would be. On a touch
         device there is no gutter and the two are the same thing. `data-lenis-prevent` is what lets it
         scroll while the page behind it does not, and it only applies where the
         pointer actually is — starting the panel lower left a strip at the top
         where a wheel landed on the header instead and nothing moved at all. -->
